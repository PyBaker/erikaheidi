### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Erika Heidi (she/her), a developer and content creator, passionate about open source and creating technical content for a variety of audiences. I have a strong background in PHP and its ecosystem, also in Linux and systems administration. 

I enjoy [live coding](https://twitch.tv/erikaheidi) from time to time and [drawing](https://dev.to/erikaheidi/pick-squash-drop-rebase-comic-607) as educational resources. In my free time, I like to tinker with 3D printing and play Animal Crossing ðŸ˜„

Here's some projects I'm excited about right now:

- [Minicli](https://github.com/minicli/minicli) - A minimalist framework for command-line centric PHP apps.
- [Librarian](https://github.com/minicli/librarian) - An experimental file-based CMS in PHP.
- [Minileaf](https://github.com/erikaheidi/minileaf) - A command-line client to control Nanoleaf panels, written in PHP.
